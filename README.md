## üìñ Overview

This is a mono repository for my home infrastructure and Kubernetes cluster implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices using tools like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## ‚õµ Kubernetes

My Kubernetes cluster is built upon bare-metal nodes running Talos, with Longhorn providing hyper-converged block storage.
A separate TrueNAS system also exists externally for NFS storage - mostly for media and backups.

### Core Components

- **[flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2)**: Manages the cluster state using GitOps
- **[longhorn](https://longhorn.io/)**: Provides distributed block storage for stateful applications
- **[renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate)**: Keeps application dependencies up-to-date

### GitOps

[Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches this Git repository and makes the appropriate changes to the cluster based on the YAML manifests in the [kubernetes](./kubernetes/) directory. 

[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) also watches this Git repository and creates pull requests when it finds updates to Docker images, Helm charts, and other dependencies.

### Directories

This Git repository contains the following directories under [kubernetes](./kubernetes/).

```sh
üìÅ bootstrap       # Initial installation components
üìÅ kubernetes      # Kubernetes cluster defined as code
‚îú‚îÄüìÅ apps          # Apps deployed into cluster grouped by namespace
‚îî‚îÄüìÅ flux          # Main Flux configuration of repository
```

## üîß Hardware

All hardware was cobbled together second-hand from Craigslist or eBay.
